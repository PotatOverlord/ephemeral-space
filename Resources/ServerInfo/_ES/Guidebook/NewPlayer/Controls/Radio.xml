# Speech and Text Channels
Talking is a key part of Ephemeral Space. You can press [keybind="FocusChatInputWindow"/] to jump to the text box.

The word next to the text box is the [color=#a4885c]text channel[/color] you're about to send the message to, or rather how you're about to say what you've typed.

Local is normal speech at normal volume.

Whisper can only be heard when nearby somebody. You automatically whisper into your radio to send messages over it.

Emotes are gestures that you make. Can be received by anyone who is not blinded.

Whisper messages can be sent by starting your message with [color=#a4885c][keybind="FocusWhisperChatWindow"/][/color] and Emotes can be sent by starting your message with ([color=#a4885c]@[/color]).
You can also cycle through all of these text channels by pressing [keybind="CycleChatChannelForward"/].

People may not be able to make out all of what you're saying if you're standing too far away from them. This is especially important if you're whispering.

## Radio

Your radio, and intercoms, allows you to communicate across the entire station and to your specific [color=#a4885c]department[/color].

To send a [color=#a4885c]station-wide[/color] message over the radio, find an [color=cyan]intercom[/color], turn its microphone on, and use the [color=#32cd32]Common[/color] channel by beginning your text with [color=#32cd32]semi-colon (;)[/color].
People standing right next to you might catch bits of your radio message, even if they don't have the access to the relevant radio channel. Watch for eavesdroppers.

Unlike other servers, Ephemeral Space does not have [color=#32cd32]Common[/color] microphone access on regular headsets.

## Departmental Radio

You are able to send messages over your departmental radio channels using [color=#32cd32]colon (:)[/color] followed by the department letter as long as you're wearing a headset with your department's encryption key.

Examine your headset to see the department channels available to you.

Examining an unmodified engineering headset would show you the prefixes for the [color=#32cd32]Common[/color] and [color=#f37746]Engineering[/color] channels.

It is also possible to use [color=#a4885c]:h[/color]. This hotkey will automatically default to your department radio channel.
For example, if you're a Station Engineer then [color=#a4885c]:h[/color] will default to [color=#f37746]:e[/color].

## Encryption Keys
[color=#a4885c]Encryption keys[/color] give you access to their respective channel.

Examining our engineering headset from earlier shows us [color=#f37746]Engineering[/color] because an engineer's headset starts with that [color=#a4885c]encryption key[/color].

</Box>

You can take out encryption keys by using a [color=#a4885c]screwdriver[/color] on a headset. New encryption keys are put into headsets by clicking on one with an encryption key in your hand.

All command members have extras of their relevant encryption key, but you can also request one at the HoP's office when you're getting your job changed.
