# Station and Shifts

Every round of Ephemeral Space is a [bold]self-contained shift[/bold] that takes place on one of many different stations.

Rounds typically last from [color=cyan]45 to 90 minutes[/color], but players are free to leave and join at any point during a round.

## Navigation
Every station has a wide variety of locations to visit.
These range from specific departments where work happens to common areas where you can relax and chat with others.

[color=cyan]Station maps[/color] give you an overview of the entire station with colored markers denoting locations of different things.
Regular [color=cyan]signs[/color] on walls can point you to different departments.
