  Every order begins at a [color=cyan]Cargo Request Computer[/color]. First and foremost, making an order requires that Cargo has enough spesos. If Cargo doesn't have the money, get some.

  It is also the sole discretion of Cargo to fulfill any given request. If Cargo is tight on spesos, they are free to deny requests that are not immediately necessary.

  To make an order, click the name of whatever is requested, provide the recipient, type an appropriate reason for why they need it, and then press "Approve" on the order.

  Sometimes a public Cargo Request Computer exists, in which case all you need to do is approve orders that people make themselves.
