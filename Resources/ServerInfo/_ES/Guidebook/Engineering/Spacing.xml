  # Spacing
  Spacing is the most common form of atmospheric upset that can occur on the station.

  While the damage that caused the spacing is often time-consuming to [textlink="fix" link="ESExpandingRepairingStation"], the actual spacing problem can be quickly resolved by simply repressurizing the area.

  Fixing spacing generally follows two simple steps:

  1. Identify the area that has been spaced and [textlink="seal the hole." link="ESExpandingRepairingStation"]

  - If you're having trouble finding the hole, you can carefully listen for the flow of air rushing by you, if air is currently leaking to space.
  - Look for any holes underneath girders that may be hard to see.

  2. Repressurize the area.

  - [textlink="Air vents" link="ESAirVent"] enter pressure lockout in order not to lose more air to spacing, so you'll need to override the vents to repressurize the area. You can do this by setting the connected [textlink="air alarm" link="ESAirAlarms"] to fill, or by right-clicking on the vent and selecting 'Release pressure lock out' to manually override it temporarily.

  ## Things to Avoid
  - Keep in mind that while you have an infinite supply of [textlink="mined gas" link="ESGasMiningAndStorage"], it is not quick enough to fill up multiple rooms at once. Setting [textlink="air alarms" link="ESAirAlarms"] to fill first [italic]before[/italic] fixing the root problem will often lead to wasted time and gas.

  - Leaving [textlink="air alarms" link="ESAirAlarms"] on the Fill mode unsupervised may lead to overpressuring a room, which can potentially harm crew if it gets out of hand.
